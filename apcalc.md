# AP Calculus AB & BC Course
Welcome to my online free AP Calculus AB & BC course. I will post everything AP Calculus related here. The goal is to prepare for either the AB exan or the BC exam, both administed by College Board. The goal is not to properly learn and enjoy calculus, unfortunately. Content is kept to the minimum of what is needed for each exam. Good luck**!**.
